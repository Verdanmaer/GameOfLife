    <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        The <b>Game of Life</b> is a cellular automaton devised by the British
        mathematician <b>John Horton Conway</b> in 1970. The game is a
        zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
        initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the
        <b>Game of Life</b> by creating an initial configuration and observing
        how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal
        constructor or any other Turing machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The universe of the <b>Game of Life</b> is a two-dimensional grid of
        square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or
        dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts
        with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally,
        vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following
        transitions occur:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by
          underpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
          generation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
          overpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell,
          as if by reproduction.
        </li>
      </ol>
